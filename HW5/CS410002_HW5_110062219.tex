\section{Assembly Coding}

\subsection{Evidence of Correctness}

In addition, I generated a testcase of length 25 and also pass it.

In fact, I came up with the assembly codes from C codes degree by degree. So I submitted my vary low-level, assembly-like, i.e., to name variables after registers and use \texttt{goto} and labels instead of loops, \href{https://atcoder.jp/contests/dp/submissions/41496401}{C codes} to AtCoder and got accepted to ensure the correctness.

\subsection{Flowchart}

First, I store the address of $arr$ in \texttt{a0} and $n$ in \texttt{a1}. By means of technique similar to \textbf{rolling array}, we needn't maintain the whole $dp$. Instead, we only need keep track of the 3 recent elements of $dp$, which are stored in \texttt{s0}, \texttt{s1} and \texttt{s2}, respectively. Likewise, I only record the 3 recent elements of $arr$ in \texttt{s3}, \texttt{s4} and \texttt{s5}, respectively, and advance \texttt{a0}, recede \texttt{a1} each time in loops.

The most notable part of my codes is that, as a competitive programmer, I tend to calculate the minimum and abstract values by fancy and elegant \textbf{bitwise operations} rather than \textbf{branches}. Due to 2's complement, we have $$\min\{l,r\}=r\oplus((l\oplus r)\land-(l<r))$$ and $$|x|=(x\oplus(x\gg(\text{sizeof}(x)\times\text{BYTE\_BITS}-1)))-(x\gg(\text{sizeof}(x)\times\text{BYTE\_BITS}-1))$$.

\section{Hazards in Codes}

\subsection{R-type RAW (EX)}

The \texttt{srai} instruction at line 38 reads the register \texttt{s2} as its first operand, which is written by the \texttt{sub} instruction at line 36. As a consequence, an EX hazard would occur.

In this case, the forwarding unit would set the signal \texttt{alu\_reg1\_forwarding\_ctrl} to be \texttt{MemStage}.

\subsection{R-type RAW (MEM)}

The \texttt{xor} instruction at line 39 reads the register \texttt{s2} as its first operand, which is written by the \texttt{sub} instruction at line 36. Therefore, a MEM hazard would occur.

In this case, the forwarding unit would set the signal \texttt{alu\_reg1\_forwarding\_ctrl} to be \texttt{WbStage}.

\subsection{Load RAW Immediately}

The \texttt{sub} instruction at line 36 reads the register \texttt{s5} as its second operand, which is written by the \texttt{lw} instruction at line 35. Accordingly, a load-use hazard would occur.

In this case, the hazard unit have to reset the signal \texttt{hazardFEEnable} to stall the pipeline, inserting a \texttt{nop} bubble between the two instructions. And then, in the next cycle, the forwarding unit would set the signal \texttt{alu\_reg2\_forwarding\_ctrl} to be \texttt{WbStage}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Load RAW Between One Instruction}

The \texttt{sub} instruction at line 57 reads the register \texttt{s5} as its first operand, which is written by the \texttt{lw} instruction at line 52. (There are 2 blank lines and a comment line in between.) Whence a hazard would occur.

In this case, the forwarding unit would set the signal \texttt{alu\_reg1\_forwarding\_ctrl} to be \texttt{WbStage}.

\subsection{Branches}

\textsf{Ripes} happens to be of the \textbf{always-not-taken} policy. So when  branches taken place actually, for instance at line 80, then the \texttt{clear} of \texttt{ID/EX} and \texttt{IF/ID} must be triggered and the pipeline is flushed thereby.
